## üìù Agent Documentation Guidelines

### Where to Write Documentation

When agents need to create documentation files (design docs, analysis reports, guides, etc.), they should **write to the `scratch_files/` directory** instead of the repository root.

**Example:**
- ‚ùå DON'T: Create `MY_ANALYSIS.md` in root
- ‚úÖ DO: Create `scratch_files/MY_ANALYSIS.md`

### Why?

The repository root should contain only essential documentation files:
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `AGENTS.md` - Agent guidelines (this file)
- Other critical docs

The `scratch_files/` directory is where agents can freely write:
- Analysis and investigation reports
- Design documents
- Planning notes
- Implementation guides
- Troubleshooting docs
- Architecture diagrams
- Any other supporting documentation

### File Naming

Agent-generated documentation in `scratch_files/` can use any naming convention:
- Capitalized markdown files are fine (e.g., `ANALYSIS.md`, `DESIGN.md`)
- Descriptive names are encouraged
- Dates/timestamps are helpful (e.g., `2025-10-25_investigation.md`)
